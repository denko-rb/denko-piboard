# Tested on Radxa Zero 3W, running Armbian, Kernel 6.1.75-vendor-rk35xx
#
# Note: Overlays are not packaged with Armbian for some reason. Hopefully this changes soon,
# but I've built the .dtbo files for the kernel given above, and made them available here:
#   https://github.com/vickash/linux-sbc-overlays/tree/master/radxa/rockchip
# To use them, save all the .dtbo files into:
#   /boot/dtb/rockchip/overlay
