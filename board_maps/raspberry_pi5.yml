#
# This is based on Rasperry Pi documentation, but UNTESTED in hardware.
# It should work for the Raspberry Pi 5.
#   - GPIO line numbers are same as older Pis, but the gpiochip has changed from 0 to 4.
#   - dtparam/dtoverlay for PWM, I2C and SPI are all unchanged, based on info from:
#       https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/blob/master/boot/overlays/README
#   - Expected to work on current Raspberry Pi OS.
